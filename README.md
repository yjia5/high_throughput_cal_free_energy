# high_throughput_cal_free_energy
This repository contains jupyter notebooks of applying API of Material Project Database to do high-throughput calculations of free energy and reaction enthalpy

### 1st Step
pipe_cal_energy.ipynb is the jupyter notebook is to perform high-throughput first-principle calculation of the energy of zero-temperature of the selected chemicals

### 2nd Step
Pipe_get_energy.ipynb is the jupyter notebook is to grep the energy result from the calculation done in the 1st step. And then the reaction enthalpy of reaction is calculated.
